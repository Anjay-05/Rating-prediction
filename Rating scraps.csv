4337,Using since 1 year. Fully satisfied.Suggestions for buyers and users-1. If you think that printing cost is high then try refilling the cartridge. It cost 150 rupees per bottle of ink and has 100 ml. Cartridge can be refilled upto 20-25 times from ink bottle. After refilling the printing cost of color mode comes down to 0.99 to 1.20 rupees and black 0.30 rupees estimated by me.2. No problem with software.3. If refilling cartridge then you require some technical guidelines and can search on...READ MORE,5

4951,"So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend.  If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.READ MORE",5

I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.READ MORE",5
5068,"So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend.  If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.READ MORE",5

5070,This is my first DSLR and it's amazing.I can take sharp photos seamlessly. I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light.

5076,It's a nice budget entry level mirrorless camera with whole lot of features. Auto focus is amazing for stills and 3/5 for moving objects. Picture clarity is also amazing with different resolutions and quality to pick from. Video quality is also amazing but limited to 15 mins. Night photography is also good with night mode.

5219,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box..If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it.If u want a home theater effect dont go for it.While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.READ MORE,3
5220,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two.  All functions mentions work perfectly fine.  Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.READ MORE,4

It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two.

It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two.
